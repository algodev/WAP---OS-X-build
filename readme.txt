WAP was originally part of a 1 week long game jam but has now taken on a life beyond that.  
This is due to it being part of the TinderBox (https://www.progfrog.co/projects/34-tinderbox-indie-arcade/log) repertoire of games.

WAP is a remake of the classic Atari game Warlords.  Four players each try to knock out the bricks of their opponent and ultimately the target protected behind the brick wall.
Knocking out the target removes that player from the game, the last player standing wins.

Each player moves a paddle in front of their wall to deflect the ball towards opponents.  A player can also catch and hold the ball when it hits their paddle and then throw the
ball in whatever direction the paddle is pointing when the catch/hold button is released.

A player can also curve a ball in flight after throwing it by moving the joystick (keyboard direction keys).  Curving is in effect after throwing until the ball hits something.

To start the game, each player has to select whether a human is playing or a bot will play.  The set up screen shows this as choosing either the white or green button as follows:

Player   Human       Bot
------   -----       ---
Blue     rt. shift   /
Red      F           C
Yellow   '           ;
Green    9           8



The bots are easy to beat and don't really provide a fun experience.  The fun part is when all four players are humans.  This is next to impossible if all four have to use the 
keyboard and that is where game controllers come in.


This game is also much easier to play with controllers than keyboard.  On OS X, PS 3 controllers have been tested but you need to buy a mapping app such as (Joystick Mapper - available from the App store).



Once all four player modes are selected, the game starts.   Use these control mappings:.

Player   Up          Down          Right           Left           Catch/Hold
------   --          ----          -----           ----           ----------
Blue     up arrow    down arrow    right arrow     left arrow     M
Red      W           S             D               A              V
Yellow   U           J             H               K              O
Green    2           3             4               1              5


Each players paddle movement pairs two input directions with one output direction.  For instance, Blue has Up/Right coupled and Down/Left coupled.  This makes more sense when using an actual joystick.





When playing the game, you can exit back to the setup screen by holding down two buttons simultaneously for any player.  You must hold these buttons (keys) for about 5 seconds.

When at the game setup screen, holding these same buttons down will quit the game.


Quit Button Mappings:

Player   Button 3    Button 4
------   --------    --------
Blue     .           /
Red      Y           C
Yellow   L           ;
Green    7           8
